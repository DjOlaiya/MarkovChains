In this project, I use a homogenous finite markov chain to model the economic transition of countries--essentially, I am attempting to answer questions like these:

1) Assuming a country is currently classified as Low Income, what is the possibility that it might become a Superpower

2) What is the steady state distribution of countries; what is the probability that a country is classified as Low Income, Middle Income, Upper Middle INcome, etc?

3) If a country is currently low ranked, how long will it remain there?

Etc. 
 
The initial distribution is taken from data gathered from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
